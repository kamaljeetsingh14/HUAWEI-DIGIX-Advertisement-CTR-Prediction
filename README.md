# HUAWEI-DIGIX-Advertisement-CTR-Prediction

Aim: Based on a set of features determine the click through rate for mobile
advertising.

Data description :
The datasets (after being masked) contain the advertising behavior data
collected from seven consecutive days, including a training dataset and a
testing dataset. This section describes the data format. Detailed data fields
are illustrated in the following sections.
Data has a label (Target variable) taking value 0 (add not clicked) and 1(
add clicked) and 35 features including numerical features like
app_score,membership_life_duration etc. and categorical features like
gender, career etc.

Brief details :
In this project we want to predict the label whether a user will click on an ad
(label 1) or not (label 0). This is a classification problem.
We want to use different classification algorithms (logistic , decision trees,
boosting and bagging methods etc. ) and dimension reduction techniques
